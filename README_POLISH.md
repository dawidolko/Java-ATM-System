# 1. Project Assumptions Description

In today's era, as the banking sector evolves with unprecedented speed, we encounter challenges related to technology adaptation and maintaining high-quality customer service. One of the key elements of this ecosystem is ATMs, which constitute an important point of contact with the customer. Unfortunately, with the increase in banking operations' complexity and growing customer expectations, ATMs often become the object of operational errors, failures, and even criminal activity. These problems, although not directly related to the bank's main activity, significantly affect the financial institution's image, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

Developed **an innovative ATM operation simulation system**. This tool not only allows for precise modeling and analysis of various ATM operation scenarios but also serves as a training platform for employees. Thanks to this system, it is possible to detect and prevent potential problems, as well as optimize customer service processes.

The project **"ATM"** is a comprehensive GUI application aimed at simulating operations performed on a real ATM. It provides users with a graphical interface, through which they can verify identity using an electronic card and PIN number, and then perform basic banking operations. The application supports Visa, American Express, Visa Electron, Mastercard, Diners Club, Japan Credit Bureau cards.

The application is built on **Java Swing** in the **IntelliJ IDEA** environment and uses **MySQL** as a relational database management system, allowing for structured and secure data storage and management. Specifically, the database consists of three main relational tables:

- `account_status`: stores information about account status, including the balance of each card.
- `cards`: contains information about available electronic cards and their assigned PIN numbers.
- `tablehistory`: records the transaction history, including the type of operation, amount, and transaction date.

Each user interaction is verified by the system by checking the entered PIN numbers against those stored in the `cards` table. Upon successful authorization, the user has access to ATM functions such as checking the balance, cash withdrawal and deposit, and viewing transaction history.

Additionally, the application offers unique features to improve user experience:

- The ability to adjust the background music volume, which is a rarity in traditional ATMs, but significantly enhances the comfort of using the application.
- Functionality for exporting and importing database data, allowing for easy transfer of the application's state between different environments or quick system restoration to a previous state.

Each of these features is implemented with maximum convenience and intuitiveness in mind, supported by a clear and responsive user interface created using Java Swing. The "ATM" project is not only a demonstration of programming skills but also an attempt at innovation in the interaction between humans and automated banking systems.

### Project Goals and Assumptions

1. **Project goal**: Design an ATM operation simulation system intended not only for educating and training bank employees but also for testing and optimizing the actual operation of ATMs.
2. **Problem and its source**: The problem related to the limited access to practical training in ATM operation will be addressed. The primary source of the problem is the lack of appropriate simulation tools that safely replicate the realities of these devices' work.
3. **Importance of the problem and evidence**: The lack of practical training tools leads to an increase in the risk of operational errors and fraud, as confirmed by reports on ATM handling errors by newly hired personnel.
4. **What is necessary to solve the problem**: It is necessary to create an interactive application simulating ATM work, which will enable practical training of employees and testing of new functions without financial risk.
5. **How the problem will be solved**: The problem will be solved through the phased development of software, starting from the design of the user interface and ending with integration with real banking systems. The result will be an application allowing for the simulation of various ATM usage scenarios.
6. **Assumptions for the project**: The project assumes that the application will be flexible and scalable, allowing for continuous addition of new functionalities and easy adaptations to the changing requirements of digital banking.

This required particular attention to details and testing to ensure the application's correct operation. Moreover, a significant part of the project involved preparing documentation, suggesting that considerable emphasis was placed on accurately describing the system's specifications and functionalities.

The project was carried out using the Git version control system, all project source files are located at: [https://github.com/dawidolko/java-ATM-system.git](https://github.com/dawidolko/java-ATM-system.git) and will be available until 01.31.2025.

![project](img/photo6.png)

# 5. Presentation of the Project's User Interface Layer

The "ATM" program operates once all classes are connected with the tables from the database, which we connect using SQL and JDBC through SQL-Connector-j-8.2.0.jar. To do this, we need to download the JAR file from the [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) page. Let's choose the platform according to the drawing below.

![project](img/photo7.png)

Once downloaded, it must be uploaded to the IntelliJ IDEA project. After completing this step, let's go to the project settings by clicking FILE -> Project Structure, and then proceed according to the picture below.

![project](img/photo8.png)

Then, transfer the downloaded file to the project folder, as shown in the picture below.

![project](img/photo9.png)

Once this has been done, we create a database using xampp, which can be downloaded from the Internet at this link [https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html). After installing and launching xampp, let's activate the Apache and MySQL modules, as shown in the picture below.

![project](img/photo10.png)

After connecting and launching the Apache and MySQL ports, let's connect to the browser at the address: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin), which will automatically transfer us to our local server. There, by clicking the "New" tab, we create a new database named "atm", which is important because the program will not connect to a database with

a different name, resulting in an error. After creating the "atm" database, go to the "SQL" tab and add 3 queries creating tables with values. We can adjust the values according to preferences, but remember that the columns must have exactly the same names as stated below, as the "ATM" program will use these names.

![project](img/photo11.png)

### "ATM" Program

Once these contents have been added to the database, you can start working with the "ATM" program. Starting with the class that will connect all classes using our previously created database, the class responsible for this is "DatabaseConnector". The "DatabaseConnector" class serves as a central point for establishing a connection with the database. It is an exemplary design pattern used in Java applications to isolate database connection details from the rest of the application.

#### Description of the DatabaseConnector Class's Operation

The class defines three constants - `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USER`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`. These constants store the information necessary to connect to the database, including the URL (database address), username, and password. In this class, they are set to specific values that indicate a local MySQL database (`jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/atm`).

#### The connect() Method

`connect()` is the main method in the "DatabaseConnector" class, used to establish a connection with the database. Here's what happens during its invocation:

- Loading the Driver: Java requires loading the appropriate database driver before establishing a connection. In newer versions of JDBC, the driver loads automatically, so this step can often be skipped.

- Establishing a Connection: The method `DriverManager.getConnection()` is used with previously defined constants `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USER`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` to create and return a Connection object. This Connection object is later used by other parts of the application to send SQL queries and manage transactions with the database.

- Exception Handling: In case of connection issues (e.g., incorrect login details, the database not running, etc.), the method throws a `RuntimeException` with an appropriate error message. This allows the calling code to handle the connection problem appropriately.

#### Usage

The "DatabaseConnector" class is typically used throughout the application to obtain a connection with the database. For example, other classes that need to execute an SQL query can first call `DatabaseConnector.connect()` to obtain a Connection object, and then use this object to execute the query.

#### Summary

"DatabaseConnector" is an essential part of the application, allowing for abstraction and centralization of database connection management. By isolating connection details and the way to obtain a connection, this class provides flexibility (ease of changing databases, connection parameters, etc.) and code cleanliness, reducing code repetition and centralizing database handling in one place.

### The Main Class "Main"

The "Main" class serves as the main entry point to the application. It uses the connection with the database through the "DatabaseConnector" class to retrieve information about cards (id, type, PIN) from the cards table. This is done in a try-with-resources block, which ensures automatic closure of resources after the operation is completed. After retrieving the data, the application displays the working directory path and launches the user interface Dashboard, which is likely a control panel or management screen.

This class primarily focuses on two aspects:

- Connecting to the database and retrieving data: It uses SQL queries to retrieve data from the cards table in the database and processes these data in the context of the application.

- Launching the user interface: After retrieving the data and handling database operations, the program initiates and displays the user interface (Dashboard), which serves as the main application window.

### The Class "MainRandomPassword"

"MainRandomPassword" is an alternative version of the Main class that generates random PIN numbers for different types of cards and updates them in the database. This can be useful for resetting or initializing PIN data in the system. Here are the key aspects of this class's operation:

#### Connecting to the Database

Like Main, it connects to the database using `DatabaseConnector`.

#### Generating Random PINs

It uses the `Random` class to generate random PIN numbers for defined types of cards.

#### Updating the Database

For each type of card, the class updates the PIN number in the database using the randomly generated numbers. The function "updateCardPin" is responsible for updating the PIN in the database.

#### Differences Between Main and MainRandomPassword

While Main is used for retrieving data from the database and launching the UI, MainRandomPassword has a specific application in generating and updating random PIN numbers for cards. It can be assumed that MainRandomPassword is an administrative tool or part of the system initialization process, where it is necessary to ensure that all cards have set PINs, perhaps before the system is launched or as part of regular security procedures.

#### Why MainRandomPassword Exists

"MainRandomPassword" exists as a separate functionality for resetting or initializing card PINs in the system. It can be used for mass

setting or resetting PINs, which is useful in various administrative scenarios, such as initial system launch, periodic resetting for security, or when an organization decides to change the PIN scheme for its cards. It is an example of how an application can include auxiliary or administrative tools in addition to its main functionality.

### User Interface Dashboard

![project](img/photo12.png)

- **'MAIN MENU' Header**: The screen title, informing the user that they are in the main menu of the application.

- **'CHOOSE YOUR CARD TYPE' Selection Box**: A ComboBox that allows the user to select the type of card (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, etc.) they wish to interact with.

- **'INSERT YOUR CARD' Button**: A button that the user can use to "insert" the selected card, likely initiating a verification process or transaction.

- **Radio Buttons for Card Type**: A group of radio buttons allowing the user to choose the kind of card (ATM CARD, PAY CARD, CREDIT CARD) which may change the options or processes available depending on the selection.

- **'LEAVE' Button**: Allows the user to exit the application.

- **'SET THE MUSIC VOLUME' Volume Adjustment**: A slider for adjusting the volume of sounds in the application, which may pertain to audio signals issued by the application during various actions.

![project](img/photo14.png)

- **Extended Dropdown List**: Displays all available card types that the user can select. In this case, it shows various types of payment cards, such as Visa, American Express, Visa Electron, Mastercard, Diners Club, Japan Credit Bureau.

- **Functionality**: When the user selects a card type and clicks 'INSERT YOUR CARD', the application may proceed to the next stage, which might require entering a PIN or performing another action.

- **'EXPORT' and 'IMPORT' Buttons**: Used to manage application data. 'EXPORT' allows saving data to a CSV file, which can be used for creating backups or transferring data between systems. 'IMPORT' enables loading data from a CSV file, useful for restoring data or updating the system with new information.

- **Application Sounds**: The ability to adjust the volume indicates that the application includes multimedia elements, such as sounds, that may be played during various actions, for example, when a card is accepted or rejected, or during cash withdrawal.

Overall: The Dashboard is designed to enable easy interaction with the system and manage payment cards and transactions. All these elements are designed with intuitiveness in mind, so that the user can quickly and effectively use the functions offered by the system.

### PinWindow - PIN Entry Interface

![project](img/photo15.png)

- **"ENTER YOUR CARD PIN" Header**: Informs the user that they should enter their PIN here.

- **PIN Entry Text Field**: Where the user enters their PIN. Typically, entered digits are obscured by asterisks or dots for security.

- **"ENTER" Button**: After entering the PIN, the user presses this button to submit and process the information.

- **"RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU" Button**: Allows the user to return to the main menu without entering a PIN.

![project](img/photo16.png)

- **PIN Validation**: The entered PIN is validated using defined rules. If the PIN is too short (less than 4 digits), the user receives an error message informing them of the incorrect PIN length.

- **Account Lock**: If the user enters the wrong PIN several times in a row, the account is locked for a specific time, signaled by an appropriate message with a countdown of seconds remaining until unlocking.

![project](img/photo17.png)

- **Event Handling**: Handling the "ENTER" Button: Upon clicking this button, the code processes the entered PIN and compares it to the PIN stored in the database. If the PIN is correct, the user may proceed; if not, an error message may be displayed, or the account may be locked.

- **Return to the Main Menu**: The "RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU" button allows the user to cancel the process and return to the previous interface.

- **Error Messages**: One of the pictures shows a message about a locked account, indicating that the system has implemented a security mechanism that locks access after several failed PIN entry attempts. Another picture shows a message stating that the PIN is too short, suggesting that the system expects a four-digit code.

- **Backend (Code)**: In the code, the PinWindow class is responsible for creating and managing this window. It uses the checkPin method to verify the entered PIN. The system counts failed PIN entry attempts and can lock the account for a specific time (lockout

EndTime), as shown in one of the messages. In case of correct PIN entry, the application likely proceeds to the next window or performs the next action, which is not visible in the submitted code.

Overall Analysis: PinWindow is a crucial element of the banking application, ensuring secure access to the user's account. PIN code verification, error handling, and account locking after failed attempts are standard practices in applications requiring authorization. The interface is simple and straightforward, minimizing the risk of user errors and enhancing security.
